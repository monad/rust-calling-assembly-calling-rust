# rust-calling-assembly-calling-rust
This is some example code of calling Assembly from Rust and calling Rust from Assembly.

# what
It's a Rust function, which calls a label written in Assembly, which calls a (different) exported Rust function.

# why
There were no good examples on how to do either of those things.

# how 2 build
I've tested with Nightly and Stable as of the time of this writing and it works, I kind of need this so if it breaks I'll probably update it. Or you can PR.
